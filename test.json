One question that’s come up time and again in the Finimize Community is, “When should I sell?” And while there are several ways to skin that particular cat, the two approaches outlined below should help guide you to an answer.\n\n",

You might have forecasted how much money the company will earn in the future – and therefore worked out how much its shares should end up being worth.\n\nAnalysts call that figure a **price target**. Ideally, an investor who’d bought shares on this basis would keep them until the price target was hit. You’d then look to sell them on and invest the resulting cash in more attractive opportunities.\n\nBut sometimes the right time to sell is *before* a stock hits your price target. A company might, for example, fall short of your earnings expectations, leaving it less likely to achieve the price target you had in mind in the time period you’d planned. Or sentiment could shift against you: investors might fall out of love with growth stocks, for instance.\n\nWhenever you raise or lower your price target, it’s helpful to ask yourself this question: **would I buy these shares (again) today, knowing everything I know about the company now?** You should almost always be able to answer “yes” – since that’s effectively what you’re doing on every day you don’t sell. If the answer’s no, then it’s probably time to cash in your chips and put that money to work elsewhere.\n\n## Managing your position\n\nOf course, you might’ve bought into a stock without a specific price target in mind. If that’s the case, don’t sweat it – there are other techniques that can help you figure out both when and how much to sell.\n\nA tried-and-true method involves simply **selling half your stake in a stock once it doubles**. That lets you take your initial investment off the table while remaining well able to benefit from any further increases. Of course, share prices doubling isn’t exactly an everyday occurrence, even if it’s not unheard of with smaller stocks.\n\n**A more conservative approach** would be to sell 20% of your position in a stock after it rises 40%, then sell 20% of what’s left after it goes up another 40%, and so on. After two turns you’ll have taken around 60% of your initial investment off the table – but will still have a stake 25% larger than you started off with. The idea’s to keep hold of your winning investments as long as possible while mitigating your risk.\n\nNevertheless, as the chart below shows, even a 40% gain’s something you’d hope to see a stock deliver over a matter of years rather than months or days. (Note also that this technique employed a “stop-loss” that triggered a total sale upon the investment falling 20% from its last peak.)\n\n",

Similarly, most people lock in profits too soon.\n\nOne of the secrets to a properly performing portfolio is going against these natural instincts and putting in place processes – even if only a couple – that can protect and reward you no matter where you are on your investing journey.\n\n",
